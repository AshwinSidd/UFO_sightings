# UFO_sightings

***Overview***
I created a website that provided an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, by allowing site users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

***Results***
Earlier, I could filter data only by searching for sightinfgs by date. Now other criteria have been added where one can search for sightings by entering the name of the city, state, country and even the shape of the UFO that was sighted. As you can see the Image 1 is the criteria when the filter have not been updated. In image 2, the search criteria is updated to look for sightings in Florida. 

*Before updating filter* -

***Summary***
Drawback - The user doesnt have a ready list of city names where UFO have been sighted, so when a city name is added, say for example Washington, nothing shows up. Maybe the filter can have a drop down menu function rather, which will list the names of the cities where UFO have been sighted.
While the website in itself is pretty user friendly, it may not be device friendly. Probably adding elements that resize the webpage could make it device friendly.
Additionally, the table can also contain another column with a link to the article or an image box, to make it more insightful experience.
